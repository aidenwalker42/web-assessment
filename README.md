Individual organisations have servers (a computer dedicated to sending/receiving data with a client computer like the one you're on now). These servers can send the data (the website) to your computer -- you request this information by connecting to a web url in a web browser such as Chrome or Internet Explorer. The server registers where this request is coming from (your ip address) and bounces back the data. 

Computers all have their own individual numbers called IP (internet protocol) addresses. When you type in a website address (aka a domain name) your browser connects to a domain name server (DNS). The DNS then tells your browser the IP address of the website you're after (computers connect via IP addresses, not website addresses). Once your computer knows the IP that it needs it starts to connect to that server, but it often can't connect directly, it must connect to lots of servers along the way by connecting and basically saying "hi, I'm computer #x and I'm looking for computer #z.". "Okay" says the other computer, "I'll connect you to another system that's closer to that one!", and so on until the connection is made to the server you're after.
